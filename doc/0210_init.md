I'll help you create a Python script to mix nature sounds for a peaceful meditation/ambient track. We'll use the `pydub` library which is great for audio processing.

Here's a detailed solution:

```python:rainybird/sound_mixer.py
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.effects import normalize
import random

def load_and_prepare_audio(file_path, target_volume=-20):
    """Load and normalize audio to consistent volume level"""
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(file_path)
    return normalize(audio).apply_gain(target_volume - audio.dBFS)

def create_ambient_mix(bird_path, water_path, fire_path, duration_ms=180000):
    """
    Create peaceful ambient mix from bird sounds, water, and fire
    
    Parameters:
        bird_path: path to bird sounds file
        water_path: path to water sounds file
        fire_path: path to fire sounds file
        duration_ms: desired duration in milliseconds (default 3 minutes)
    """
    
    # Load and prepare audio files
    birds = load_and_prepare_audio(bird_path)
    water = load_and_prepare_audio(water_path)
    fire = load_and_prepare_audio(fire_path)
    
    # Adjust volumes for balance
    birds = birds - 5  # Slightly reduce bird volume
    water = water - 8  # Reduce water more (as background)
    fire = fire - 10   # Fire as subtle background element
    
    # Loop tracks if they're shorter than desired duration
    birds = birds * (duration_ms // len(birds) + 1)
    water = water * (duration_ms // len(water) + 1)
    fire = fire * (duration_ms // len(fire) + 1)
    
    # Trim to exact duration
    birds = birds[:duration_ms]
    water = water[:duration_ms]
    fire = fire[:duration_ms]
    
    # Add subtle fade in/out
    fade_duration = 3000  # 3 seconds
    birds = birds.fade_in(fade_duration).fade_out(fade_duration)
    water = water.fade_in(fade_duration).fade_out(fade_duration)
    fire = fire.fade_in(fade_duration).fade_out(fade_duration)
    
    # Overlay all tracks
    final_mix = birds.overlay(water)
    final_mix = final_mix.overlay(fire)
    
    # Final normalization and export
    final_mix = normalize(final_mix)
    return final_mix

def add_random_bird_calls(base_mix, bird_calls_path, num_calls=5):
    """Add occasional bird calls for more natural feeling"""
    result = base_mix
    bird_call = load_and_prepare_audio(bird_calls_path)
    
    for _ in range(num_calls):
        position = random.randint(0, len(base_mix) - len(bird_call))
        result = result.overlay(bird_call, position=position)
    
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    ambient_mix = create_ambient_mix(
        "sounds/birds_ambient.mp3",
        "sounds/water_stream.mp3",
        "sounds/campfire.mp3",
        duration_ms=180000  # 3 minutes
    )
    
    # Optional: Add random bird calls
    final_mix = add_random_bird_calls(
        ambient_mix,
        "sounds/bird_calls.mp3",
        num_calls=5
    )
    
    # Export the final mix
    final_mix.export("peaceful_forest_ambient.mp3", format="mp3", bitrate="320k")
```

This script includes several key features for high-quality sound mixing:

1. **Volume Normalization**: Each sound is normalized to ensure consistent volume levels.

2. **Balanced Mixing**:
   - Bird sounds are slightly reduced (-5dB)
   - Water sounds are more reduced (-8dB) to serve as background
   - Fire sounds are furthest in background (-10dB)

3. **Smooth Transitions**:
   - 3-second fade in/out for all tracks
   - Seamless looping for shorter tracks

4. **Natural Variation**:
   - Optional random bird calls function adds spontaneity
   - Prevents the mix from feeling too repetitive

To use this script, you'll need to:

1. Install required library:
```bash
pip install pydub
```

2. Prepare your sound files:
   - A base bird ambience track
   - A water stream sound
   - A campfire sound
   - Optional: Individual bird calls for random placement

For best results:

1. Use high-quality source files (WAV or high-bitrate MP3)
2. Ensure source files are clean (no background noise)
3. Test different volume levels for your specific sounds
4. Adjust fade durations based on your needs

The script exports the final mix in high-quality 320kbps MP3 format. You can adjust the duration, fade times, and volume levels to suit your specific needs.

Remember to handle your audio files with appropriate licensing and permissions!
